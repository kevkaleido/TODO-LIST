# WO2DO
Keep track of what needs doing and what got done with this simple todo list application built with React. The application allows users to add and remove from list with timestamps of when a task is added and when it is done. It also keeps a history of removed tasks and persists data using local storage.

## Features

- **Add Items**: Users can add new todo items with timestamps of the time these items are added.
- **Remove Items**: Users can remove todo items, and these items are saved in a history list with timestamps of the time they are marked as done.
- **Persistence**: Todos and history are saved in local storage, so they persist across sessions.
